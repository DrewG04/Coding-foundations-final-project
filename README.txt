Hello this is my final project for the HTML and CSS course i am taking.
My goal was to recreate the landing page of the website CodePen using the HTML
and CSS skills I learned from taking the course, using the reference image below.

I could not get certain text to be as bold as I would have liked them to be
using the font I chose, and I did not want to sacrifice having an accurate 
font for bolder text.

For whatever reason there is a syntax "error" in the file page-content.css
even though there isnt actually anything wrong with the syntax from what
i can tell. Either way the code run perfectly fine but I figured I should
mention it.

Coded using Visual Studio Code and assuming it would be viewed on a 1920x1080
monitor.
